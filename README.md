# Google Season Of Docs 2022 Proposal for Casbin

## What is Google Season Of Docs?

The goal of Season of Docs is to provide a framework for technical writers and open source projects to work together towards the common goal of improving an open source project's documentation. For technical writers who are new to open source, the program provides an opportunity to gain experience in contributing to open source projects. For technical writers who're already working in open source, the program provides a potentially new way of working together. Season of Docs also gives open source projects an opportunity to engage more of the technical writing community.

During the program, technical writers spend a few months working closely with an open source community. They bring their technical writing expertise to the project's documentation, and at the same time learn about the open source project and new technologies.

The open source projects work with the technical writers to improve the project's documentation and processes. Together they may choose to build a new documentation set, or redesign the existing docs, or improve and document the open source community's contribution procedures and onboarding experience.

Together, we raise public awareness of open source docs, of technical writing, and of how we can work together to the benefit of the global open source community.

## The project’s scope

Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete running Casbin & Casdoor code. They are what our project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.

They are wholly learning-oriented, and specifically, they are oriented towards learning 'how' rather than learning 'what'.

Tutorials need to be useful for the beginner, easy to follow, meaningful, extremely robust, and kept up-to-date.

The Tutorial project should:

- Allow the user to learn by doing
- Get the user started
- Make sure that the tutorial works all the time
- Ensure the user sees results immediately
- Make the tutorial repeatable
- Focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
- Provide the minimum necessary explanation
- Focus only on the steps the user needs to take
- Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the Casbin & Casdoor sites.

## What is out-of-scope for this project

- This project is not an API reference, it can link to related pages for references.
- This project is not for experienced users

We have two committer candidates for mentoring our GSoD project,
and we estimate that this work will take three months to complete.
The creators of Casbin & Casdoor have committed to supporting the project.

Rui is mainly helping the technical writers to:

1. get understand about the Documentation System: https://docusaurus.io/
2. join the Casbin community as soon as possible and understand all the tools our community is using.
3. get answered all the questions about Casbin, Casdoor and the community.

## Measuring your project’s success

As of today, Casbin site receives 3,000 page views (PVs) per day and Casdoor site receives 300 PVs per day. The average visit duration is 2 min, the bounce rate is 75%.

We will track the above metrics (page views, visit duration, and bounce rate)
monthly after the documentation is published.
We will also track the number of user getting started questions,
starting quarterly after the documentation is published.

We would consider the project successful if, after the publication of the new documentation:

- The tutorials page views increase by 50%
- The visit duration on tutorials increases by 50% (>3 minutes)
- The bounce rate of tutorials decreases by 25% (<50%)
